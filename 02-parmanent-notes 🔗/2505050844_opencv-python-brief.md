As frequently happens with computer vision, machine learning algorithms are the Centerstone due its benefits compared to traditional computation. This library thus, is the main key when it comes to processing images in this field of computation.
- **Machine learning**
- **Image feature detection** (edges, key points and contours)
- **Object detection**
- **Video analysis** (movement detection)
