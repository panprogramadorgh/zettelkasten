# What is TensorFlow Keras API ?
Keras consists of a high-level API of the TensorFlow library which provides an approachable and highly productive interface to perform machine learning tasks with emphasis in deep learning.

keras provides full access to TensorFlow capabilities while maintaining scalability across different platforms allowing the exportation of ML models.

The intention of keras is to reduce cognitive load by offering simple and **consistent interfaces**, **minimize the number of actions** , **providing clear error messages** and following a **progressive disclosure of complexity method**.

You might be interested in using keras depending who you are or what are you objectives (see [[2505061002_who-should-use-tensorflow-keras]]).
