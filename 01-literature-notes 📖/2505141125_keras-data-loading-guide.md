# Keras Data Loading Guide

Keras  data loading utilities, which are located in `tf.keras.utils`, help you go from raw data stored in disk to useful `tf.keras.Database` instances, that can be used to train efficiently a model.

These loading utilities can be combined with preprocessing layers to further transform you input dataset before training.

## Quick Intro With Images

Next we will take a look at some example of machine learning classification problem where we have to load images labeled under specific names an train a model.
