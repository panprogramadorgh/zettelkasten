# Development of Ideas for my Note Taking Application

This note contains the ideas behind what I intend to develop as main features of my note-taking application. The purpose is to describe, elaborate, find entailments and finally reach to deeper conclusions about the viability of that ideas.

After an exercise of research of other available alternatives, I've reach to the conclusion

## Value Addition Ideas

1. **A single `markdown` note can  be represented as with many different views**. The exact same concept as Notion does, where the user can create its own relational database with custom fields and information about each note, which are ultimately a markdown file (feature type: All-in-One Workspace).
	1. Tasks
	2. Cards
	3. Calendars
	4. Tables
	5. Graph
	6. And so on...
2. **Cloud Synchronization of projects** (imagine a project like an obsidian vault)
	1. **Cloud-stored Zettelkastens with open-source protocol**, which allow self-hosted projects. This feature foments the distribution of projects by allowing the users to have their own hosting (imagine this concept applied to LAN network) and entails external entities like companies to create their business model based on this application's Zettelkastens hosting (`feature type: Cross-Platform Sync and Encryption`).
	2. **Highly distribution support for projects**.
		1. Real-time multilanguage translation of projects. Them should allow editing over the translated version and push that changes so that any other person from other region will see, in turn, their translated version (`feature type: AI Assistance and All-in-One Workspace`).
3. **Artificial Intelligence Features**.
	1. **Creation of notes with by voice transcription and interpretation**. Imagine you want to treat notes as different TODO tasks, so you just start describing verbally how will you organize the day (`feature type: AI Assistance`).
	2. **Suggest learning route**. Some AI agent might process different notes navigating through the Zettelkasten and give you the most appropriated path of linked notes to start learning something that you verbally described. The AI would behave as a Markov decision process that interpretates small and atomic notes written in natural language where the target is to recommend the user which path to follow next (`feature type: AI Assistance, Graph View, Outliner Structure and All-in-One Workspace`).
	3.  **Voice commands**.
		1. **Navigate quickly to specific notes**. Eases the access just by briefly describing what is that note about (`feature type: AI Assistance`).
4. **Handwriting support oriented to on-fly drawing creation within notes** (`feature type: All-in-One Workspace`).
