There are two different approaches to existing note-taking applications.

1. Knowledge management. These are primarily designed for note-taking in Markdown format and long-term information.

2. Productivity, task management, and daily note-taking, aimed at keeping short-term information in mind.

The second option is much more competitive in the market, and there are many more alternatives.

## Main Competitors

| Categories   | Applications                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Knowledge    | Obsidian, Roam Research, Logseq, Evernote, Joplin |
| Productivity | Tana, Notion                                      |
In general case, productivity applications are much more sophisticated in terms of:
- **Functionality and personalization**. Probably as consequent of a market with higher rates of competition, existing applications are tend to implement a lot more utilities and use cases. Applications such as Notion organizes notes with a database system which allows you to customize how do you treat those (tasks, cards, calendar...).
- **Monetization**. As I've researched these sort of apps seem there have a tendency on how they build their monetization system. Compared with **knowledge management** apps, where there is a clary prevail over equivalence of software transparency and popularity, **productivity** apps are tend to be more opaque and that doesn't necessarily harm the business model.
