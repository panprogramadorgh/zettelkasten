# Development of Ideas for my Note Taking Application

This note contains the ideas behind what I intend to develop as main features of my note-taking application. The purpose is to describe, elaborate, find entailments and finally reach to deeper conclusions about the viability of that ideas.

After an exercise of research of other available alternatives, I've reach to the conclusion

## Value Addition Ideas

1. A single `markdown` note can  be represented as with many different views
	1. TODO tasks
	2. Cards
	3. and so on...
2. Cloud Synchronization of projects (imagine a project like an obsidian vault)
	1. **Cloud-stored Zettelkastens with open-source protocol**, which allow self-hosted projects. This feature foments the distribution of projects by allowing the users to have their own hosting (imagine this concept applied to LAN network) and entails external entities like companies to create their business model based on this application's Zettelkastens hosting.
	2. Highly distribution support for projects
		1. Real-time multilanguage translation of projects. Them should allow editing over the translated version and push that changes so that any other person from other region will see, in turn, their translated version.
	3. Cloud file storage service with encryption (see [services that provides suitable APIs](https://chatgpt.com/share/681e838f-6680-8003-bb08-c16c5f9567c8))
3. Artificial Intelligence Features
	1. **Creation of notes with by voice transcription and interpretation**. Imagine you want to treat notes as different TODO tasks, so you just start describing verbally how will you organize the day.
	2. **Suggest learning route**. Some AI agent might process different notes navigating through the Zettelkasten and give you the most appropriated path of linked notes to start learning something that you verbally described. The AI would behave as a Markov decision process that interpretates small and atomic notes written in natural language where the target is to recommend the user which path to follow next.
	3.  Voice commands to
		1. **Navigate quickly to specific notes**. Eases the access just by briefly describing what is that note about.
4. Handwriting support oriented to drawing creation within notes.
