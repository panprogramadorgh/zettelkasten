There are two different approaches to existing note-taking applications.

1. Knowledge management. These are primarily designed for note-taking in Markdown format and long-term information.

2. Productivity, task management, and daily note-taking, aimed at keeping short-term information in mind.

The second option is much more competitive in the market, and there are many more alternatives.

## Main Competitors

| Categories   | Applications                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Knowledge    | Obsidian, Roam Research, Logseq, Evernote, Joplin |
| Productivity | Tana, Notion                                      |
In general case, productivity applications are much more sophisticated in terms of:
- **Functionality**. Probably as consequent of a market with higher rates of competition, existing applications are tend to implement a lot more utilities and use cases. Not completely sure, just my supposition, I would say the reason why Notion is such popular regards to simplicity, or transmit that feeling at least (something similar happens with Tana).
- **Monetization**. As I've researched these sort of apps, seems there are a tendency on how they build their monetization system. Compared with **Knowledge Management** apps, where there is a clary prevail over equivalence of software transparency and popularity, **Productivity** apps are tend to be more opaque and that doesn't necessarily harm the business model.
