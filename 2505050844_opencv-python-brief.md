# OpenCV-Python

opencv-python in an essential image utility library when it comes to computer vision. It is originally written in C++ but this module provides access to its functionality by a binding.

As frequently happens with computer vision, machine learning algorithms are the Centerstone due its benefits compared to traditional computation. This library, thus y main key when it comes to processing images in this field of computation.
- Machine learning
- Image feature detection (edges, key points and contours)
- Object detection
- Video analysis (movement detection)
