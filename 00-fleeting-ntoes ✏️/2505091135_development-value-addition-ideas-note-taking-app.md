# Development of Ideas for the Note-Taking Application

This note contains the ideas behind what I intend to develop as main features of my note-taking application. The purpose is to describe, elaborate, find entailments and finally reach to deeper conclusions about the viability of that ideas.

After an exercise of research of other available alternatives, I've reach to the conclusion that this application will be denoted as an smart Zettelkasten creator where various running-local IA agents will leverage this method of managing knowledge; however it's of vital importance keep the exact same approach other competitors like Notion does â€” allow the users to create their customized manner with database of storing the notes or pages.

## Value Addition Ideas

Below there are some ideas categorized by feature type.

1. **A single `markdown` note can  be represented as with many different views**. The exact same concept as Notion does, where the user can create its own relational database with custom fields and information about each note, which are ultimately a markdown file (`All-in-One Workspace`).
	1. Tasks
	2. Cards
	3. Calendars
	4. Tables
	5. Graph
	6. And so on...
2. **Cloud Synchronization of projects** (imagine a project like an obsidian vault)
	1. **Cloud-stored Zettelkastens with open-source protocol**, which allow self-hosted projects. This feature foments the distribution of projects by allowing the users to have their own hosting (imagine this concept applied to LAN network) and entails external entities like companies to create their business model based on this application's Zettelkastens hosting (`Cross-Platform Sync`).
	2. **Highly distribution support for projects**.
		1. Real-time multilanguage translation of projects. Them should allow editing over the translated version and push that changes so that any other person from other region will see, in turn, their translated version (`AI Assistance and All-in-One Workspace`).
3. **Artificial Intelligence Features**.
	1. **Creation of notes with by voice transcription and interpretation**. Imagine you want to treat notes as different TODO tasks, so you just start describing verbally how will you organize the day (`AI Assistance`).
	2. **Suggest learning route**. Some AI agent might process different notes navigating through the Zettelkasten and give you the most appropriated path of linked notes to start learning something that you verbally described. The AI would behave as a Markov decision process that interpretates small and atomic notes written in natural language where the target is to recommend the user which path to follow next (`AI Assistance, Graph View and All-in-One Workspace`).
	3.  **Voice commands**.
		1. **Navigate quickly to specific notes**. Eases the access just by briefly describing what is that note about (`AI Assistance`).
4. **Handwriting support oriented to on-fly drawing creation within notes** (`All-in-One Workspace`).
