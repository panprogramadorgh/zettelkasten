# TensorFlow

It is an open-source Python library developed by Google (also with JavaScript support) specialized in machine learning and neural networks that allows the creation, training, and deployment of models.

With `TensorFlow` we are able to create deep learning models to perform tasks such us:
- Image recognition
- Computer vision
- Natural language processing (NLP)
